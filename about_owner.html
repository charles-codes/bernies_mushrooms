      <p class="subheader">Bernie Tuggle, the owner of the private collection of Lorenzen Mushrooms displayed on this site, penned the following essay on his interest in and love for Lorenzen Mushrooms.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, things just happen.</p>
      <p>I grew up outside Atlanta, Georgia on what was a multi-generational dairy farm.  The cows were sold in 1955, the year after I was born and the dairy was sold in 1960.  After the sale of the dairy my parents, never lacking a sense of adventure, began a series of epic summer car camping trips in our station wagon.  The most epic of which was a little drive in 1962 from Atlanta to Alaska when the Alaskan highway was still the 1500 mile gravel road built during the Second World War.  My older brother (soon to be joined in 1962 by a younger brother) and I were the lucky passengers in the back seat on these journeys.  One of these summer trips took us to the Northeastern United Status and the Canadian Maritime provinces.</p>
      <p>While in Nova Scotia, my parents (most likely my Mother) stumbled upon the Lorenzen pottery studio in Lantz which is a short distance outside Halifax.  There must have been a sign on the road which attracted my Mother’s attention as the Lorenzens were not operating a large operation – they were artists whose studio was the front room of their home.  Mother purchased three mushrooms – Clavaria fusimornis, Lepiota gracilenta and Coprinus micaceus – more as interesting and beautiful pieces of art rather than as souvenirs or curiosities.  These three little mushrooms were on her night stand as long as I can remember until she passed away at the age of 90 in 2008.</p>
      <p>After her passing, I kept the mushrooms – not really knowing what they were.  With a little bit of research, I began to learn some of the history of Ernst and Alma Lorenzen and their studio in Lantz.  Because of the connections between my parents - especially my Mother – I began collecting them.  Ebay was the easy place to begin; but over the years, auctions in Halifax and other locations led to additional acquisitions.  My wife and sons have shaken their heads at my mushroom quest, but over time they seem to have “gotten” it.</p>
      <p>I am interested in the Lorenzen mushrooms for several reasons: they are attractive not only as works of art but also as accurate mycological representations. For me the most important reason to collect them is that the mushrooms are a reminder of my Mother and what she saw in them almost sixty years ago.  My parents had many nice things in their home.  Prior to my Mother’s death, she said that her things were “just stuff”.  While she was correct the Lorenzen mushrooms are more than “just stuff” and hold special meaning to me.</p>
